# Burden of Healthcare Acquired Infections in Australia

Coauthors: Brett Mitchell, Tracey Bucknall, Allen Cheng, Phil Russo, Andrew Stewardson

## Healthcare Associated Infections {.smaller}

* Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) associated with increased morbidity and mortality
* Five of the most common HAIs are:
  * Clostridiodes difficile – causes severe damage to the colon, can be fatal
  * Bloodstream infection (sepsis) – estimated mortality rate of 15-30%
  * Urinary track infection – low mortality but associated with multi-drug resistance and significantly longer hospital stays
  * Healthcare acquired pneumonia – mortality rate of 40-70%, increasing dramatically with age
  * Surgical site infection – significantly increases length of stay

::: {.fragment}
In Australia, HAIs are not notifiable => We have no robust way to track whether their prevalence is increasing or decreasing
:::

## Europe tracks these closely

HAIs are actively monitored across Europe through the ECDC

* In 2016 (based on 2012 data), 2,609,911 new HAIs are estimated to have occurred.

The data were obtained in a point prevalence survey on an enormous scale

* 273, 753 patients
* 1,149 hospitals

## Point prevalence survey

A point prevalence survey counts the number of people with a condition on a given day

For the Australian PPS:

* Adults in 19 large acute care public hospitals were sampled
* All acute care wards were include, non-acute, paediatric, neonatal ICUs, rehab and emergency departments were excluded.

The hospitals sampled make up approximately 60% of all overnight separations in Australia

## Point prevalence survey

* 2767 patients were sampled between 6 Aug and 29 Nov 2018
* Median age: 67 (range 18-104)
* 52.9% male, 46.6% female, 0.5% unknown/other
* 85.7% patients in major city hospitals

## Estimation methodology {.smaller}

#### Step 1: Hospital prevalence

Hospital prevalence, $P$, estimated as

$$P = r \times Beta(n_{\text{obs}}, N-n_{\text{obs}}+1) + (1-r) \times Beta(n_{\text{obs}}+1, N-n_{\text{obs}})$$

## Estimation methodology {.smaller}

#### Step 2: Estimation of hospital incidence

Hospital incidence, $I$, calculated as

$$I = P \frac{\text{LA}}{\text{LOI}}$$

where

* $P$ is the hospital prevalence from step 1,
* $\text{LA}$ is the mean length of stay and
* $\text{LOI}$ is the length of infection.

::: {.fragment}
$\text{LA}$ is taken from the AIHW 2018 statistics on all public hospitals.
:::

## Estimation methodology {.smaller}

#### Step 2a: Estimation of length of infection

No data on length of infection, only $LOI_\text{pps}$, the length of stay until the date of survey.

We can calculate


$$P(LOI_\text{pps} = 1),$$

the probability a patient is in the first day of their HAI. Then, approximate $LOI$ with

$$E[LOI] = 1 / P(LOI_\text{pps} = 1).$$

For small sample sizes, results has shown this is biased, so we use a mixture of this estimator and the empirical mean.

## Estimation methodology {.smaller}

#### Step 3: Estimation of population incidence

Calculate population incidence as

$$I_{\text{pop}} = I \times N_{\text{discharges}}.$$

For us, $N_{\text{discharges}} = 3,713.513$, which is 60% of the total admissions in the year.

::: {.fragment}
This is one of the few pieces of data Australia has that the ECDC doesn't!
:::

## Estimation methodology {.smaller}

#### Step 4: Stratification by age and sex

Use a multinomial likelihood with a Dirichlet prior, with weights taken from the number of cases in each age/sex category.

A psuedocount is added to each strata ($0.001\sum \text{weights}$) to ensure likelihood can be calculated with empty strata

::: {.fragment}
This psuedocount almost surely induces bias, and there are better techniques out there.
:::

## Estimation methodology

#### Step 5: Adjustment for life expectancy

Use the McCabe score, which gives the life expectancy according to severity of disease. Patients are categorised as:

* non-fatal
* fatal (life expectancy 3 years)
* rapidly fatal (average life expectancy of 0.5 years)

These scores, combined with disease outcome trees, give DALYs and deaths.

## Novelty

* First estimate of HAI burden in Australia using (relatively) robust survey data in an established framework
* Based on first point prevalence survey since 1984

* There is no routine surveillance of HAIs in Australia
* Point prevalence surveys remain the only way to understand the burden of these conditions

## Summary

* 498 DALYs per 100,000 is a large amount
    * Motor vehicles: 180 DALYs
    * Infectious diseases: 370 DALYs
    * Respiratory diseases: 1380 DALYs

# HAIs are largely preventable.

They represent great opportunity for improvement, and we have a long way to go to prevent them entirely.

# Carbapenemase-producing enterobacterales colonisation status does not lead to more frequent admissions: a linked patient study {.smaller}

## Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales {.smaller}

* Gram-negative bacilli occurring naturally in the GI tract
* Resistant to carbapenem antibiotics
* Several different carbapenemases genes in CPE:
  * Imipenemase (IMP)
  *  Klebsiella penumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)
  *  New-Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)
  * Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and
  *  Oxacillinases (OXA)
*  For Enterobacterales, IMP(-4) most commonly found in Victoria (28% of all cases)
* Assumed to be colonised indefinitely

## Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales {.smaller}

* Surveillance officially established in Victoria in 2015, became notifiable in 2018
* Since becoming notifiable, notifications have been steadily increasing

![](images/figure1-incidence.png){fig-align="center"}

## Modelling possible control

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width='50%'}

* We know that healthcare is a network phenomenon
* Need to understand if CPE+ patients are different to CPE- patients

:::
::: {.column width='50%'}
![](images/echidna-network.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Research questions

1. How frequently are CPE+ patients admitted to a health service other than the one they are diagnosed?
2. Are patients known to be colonized with CPE admitted more often or to more locations than a random patient?

## Health Services in Victoria, Australia {.smaller}

* Health services are individually governed
* Centralised guidelines for reporitng
* Have their own IP results, testing/screening requirements, admission & transfer patterns
* Are often spread across multiple campuses which operate independently but are administered centrally

::: {.fragment}
As these services tend to operate on the same patient data platform, we assume that previously diagnosed patients will have infection prevention protocols in place if they are re-admitted to the same service.

This is less likely to be true in a different health service, as there is no centralised notification system to other health services.

:::

## Notification system

![](images/echidna-notification-letter.png){fig-align="center"}

## Data sources {.smaller}

Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset (VAED):

* Line list of every hospital admission (public and private)
* Reports demographics, conditions, treatments, timing, location

Public Health Event Surveillance System (PHESS):

* Records information on *notifiable* disease events
* Includes patient demographics, date of notification, date of test
* Operational system, used for contact tracing and outbreak analytics

## Control Population {.smaller}

To fairly compare between CPE+ and CPE- patients, construct a series of comparator populations which increasingly closely approximate the CPE+ cohort

1. Random subset: patients are randomly sampled from the population
2. Campus and time: Patients are matched to CPE-positive patients based on the hospital campus and the quarter-year (i.e. 3-month period) of admission
3. Campus, time and age: As per Cohort 2, plus the inclusion of five-year age band
4. Campus, time and comorbidities: As per Cohort 2, plus the inclusion of age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index category.

## Survival Analysis {.smaller}

Use the Kaplan-Meier estimator:

$$\hat{S}(t) = \prod_{i:t_i \leq t} 1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i}$$

where

* $d_i$ is the number of events that have happened up to time $t_i$, and
* $n_i$ is the number of individuals _known to have survived_ up to time $t_i$.

## Statistical methodology {.smaller}

To calcualte the time until next admission, we set the time 0 to be the time of discharge from a health service where CPE was diagnosed

![](images/methods-1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Statistical methodology {.smaller}

Time of event is defined to be the time at which a patient was readmitted to a new health service
Time of censoring is either death (if known) or the end of the data (30 November 2019), meaning patients have unequal study lengths.

## Admission Timing

## Conclusion

* Healthcare is a network problem, patients move very frequently
* This is true independent of CPE colonisation status
* Those who are CPE+ seem to be re-admitted faster on average
  * Are they sicker people?
  * Do they need more frequent follow up close to home?
* Design of control schemes need to consider the linked nature of health services
